Placing it aside, she leaves a trail of them for her son, Beau, to collect in his bucket. Spending hours to pick potatoes, green beans and tomatoes might not seem like something a 3-year-old would help with, but having learned these skills as a young girl Hannah continues the tradition by passing them on to Beau. Now an active 8-year-old, he helps out by feeding animals, planting seeds and helping grind their homemade sausage. “The majority of the basics of our food comes from the land,” Hannah says. 

It all started back when Hannah was a young girl living on her parents’ 100 acres of peach orchards and Black Angus cattle in Coolville, Ohio, not far from the land she now owns in Guysville. She and her sister would weed in the field at six o’clock in the morning. After chores, they would go fishing in the nearby ponds.  </p>

       <p class="flex-caption">Hannah bought the pig for $50 and raised it for about a year and a half in preparation for slaughter. She could have bought a pig ready to butcher for $47 at a stock sale, “but we also use the pig as a garbage disposal, so it works both ways” Chris says.</p>

“One summer,” she says, “I caught 80 bluegill in one sitting.” After she brought them home, Hannah cleaned the fish and ground them up to make fish burgers. “It teaches you how to cook and how to work and how to take care of yourself.”
</p>
<p>
Hannah now takes care of Beau, her elderly mother Sally and a number of animals. With help from Chris Ackley, whom she hired three years ago to help on the farm, she makes the five-minute trip to the farm at least twice a day to take care of their pigs, cow, chickens, horses, cats, dog and the neighbor’s animals. Having all of these mouths to feed and care for requires hard work — and can be challenging in her situation.
</p>
<p>
When her mother became ill, Hannah had to quit her job in order to care for her while still maintaining the farm. Sally suffers from early-onset dementia and her mobility is limited when unassisted; caring for her requires a lot of Hannah’s time. Without a job and with limited income, Hannah qualified for food stamps and began going to the Friends and Neighbors food pantry in Coolville twice a month. 
</p>
<p>
“It wasn’t like a regular thing — and it still isn’t,” says Hannah of her trips to the food pantry. “I don’t want to keep from anybody else what I don’t need,” she explains.
</p>
<p>
Hannah prefers to go to the food pantry on Fridays, a day when she can take a load of food that is about to expire. If there’s any excess, she uses it to feed her pigs and chickens, which in turn, feed her family.
</p>
<blockquote>“You don’t have to go to the market, you can get so much out of this land.” </blockquote>
<p>
Choosing to mainly rely on foods they have raised and processed themselves, means giving up the quick convenience many take for granted. Hannah raised two pigs, named Sausage and Bacon, for over a year before they were ready to be slaughtered this spring. This involved killing and cleaning the pigs, before letting them hang for a couple days. They devote time to rinsing and splitting the pork, then bringing it home to butcher, grind into sausage, divide into bacon and chops, finally smoking, packaging and storing the product.
</p>
<p>
Every year, Hannah takes gallons of fresh veggies and deer meat and begins the lengthy process of filling the canning jars. About three quarters of the jars filling her basement are ready to be eaten, the rest remain empty, ready for the next batch. It requires time — deer needs four hours on the stove — but it grants Hannah peace of mind because “everything that goes in my freezer, I’ve done it myself and I know what’s in it.”
</p>
<p>
In this increasingly busy world, where people buy instant food or depend on fast food to feed their families quickly and cheaply, the processes of subsistence farming and canning are dwindling. Most of what Hannah buys from the local Aldi supermarket she buys because she cannot make it herself. 
</p>
<p>
Areas like Guysville  — parts of which the USDA considers food desert regions — have the potential to grow food. By depending more on the soil and less on stores, the food access issue could diminish in Southeast Ohio. To people like Hannah, it is about how you use the resources you’re provided. 
</p>
<p>
“People seem to be living less and less and less off the land and using the bounty that we have here,” Hannah explains. “You don’t have to go to the market, you can get so much out of this land.”
