	  <p><span class="firstcharacter">T</span>he smell of fried eggplant and boiling pasta begins to fill a classroom at Nelsonville-York Elementary, as a group of second graders listen to an AmeriCorps member describe how citizens of Venice, Italy, use boats on their daily commute. Outside, a wall of white pines, rural farmland and rolling Appalachian hills surround the brick building. The food is served on vibrant colored plastic plates that match the numerous reds, yellows and purples in the room. The children seem weary at first but they begin to slowly chew the marinated eggplant slices coated with oregano. They aren’t all enamored by the rubbery vegetable but a handful empty their plates and shuffle over to a volunteer asking for seconds.

  	<p>Similar food classes occur once every week in second and third-grade classrooms in elementary schools all over rural Athens County, Ohio. In the first 10 weeks, children learn nutrition basics such as identifying fruits, vegetables, legumes and the essential vitamins in a healthy diet. The following 12 weeks, the kids will learn about international cultures, geography and will try Americanized versions of common dishes in these highlighted countries. Now in its fourth year, the Live Healthy Kids program is taught by 19 COMCorps members and 12 Ohio University volunteers.</p>
	<p>“There are some kids in this county that have never seen cucumbers before,” remarked Megan Norris, a Live Healthy Kids coordinator and regular teacher.
  A study conducted by the Ohio University Heritage of Osteopathic Medicine in 2010 found that “21 percent of children in Athens County are obese, compared to the national average of 16 percent.”</p>
  	<p>With such a high rate of childhood obesity within the county, Live Healthy Appalachia created the one-hour class program that would introduce children to fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains and incorporate these types of foods into their diet. They even trust the children with knives, after a training process, and they normally have them help prep ingredients for the dish.</p>
  	<p>“It’s really basic but a lot of kids then go home and say they want to help out in the kitchen more,” said Cara Haughey, the Director of Children’s Programming for Live Healthy Kids.</p>
  	  <blockquote>"Hopefully some of these recipes going home with these kids will bring some healthier options to families that are food insecure."</blockquote>
  <p>The program’s coordinators also address the affordability of the meals they serve and understand that parents associate healthy with expensive. 
  “There is huge food insecurity in this area depending on which school you are looking at. There’s sixty to seventy percent of free and reduced lunch at some of these schools. Hopefully some of these recipes going home with these kids will bring some healthier options to families that are food insecure,” said Haughey.</p>
  <p>The coordinators understand that one healthy snack a week will make little impact if the children go home and regularly consume burgers, chicken nuggets, fries and mac and cheese. They recognize the need to break the cycle of unhealthy eating habits to see real change. From parent surveys that were conducted before and after the program, they found a 20% increase of parents buying more fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grains at the grocery store.</p>
  <p>“Our biggest goal is combating childhood obesity but the only way we can do that is if the kids take it home to their parents,” said Haughey.
   “When you’ve lived forty years of your life one way, it’s incredibly difficult to change. But when you’ve lived eight years of your life and food is still one of the most fun things you have, I think there is hope they bring what they have learned to their families,” said Norris.
